        <p>In this assignment, you will create a graphical scene using Python’s Turtle graphics
            module. You will implement one of 15 unique scene variations by utilizing the provided
            starter code functions and adding your implementation of the draw_scene(t) function.
            This project will help you develop skills in programming logic, function calls, and basic
            graphical rendering.</p>

        <p>This function creates a tree by using a rectangle and one overlapping circle. The parameter allows
            for the color, width, and height. I have refactored several steps from the original code to make
            the code nice and tidy. The second function instructs the pen to draw a filled circle with color.
            
        Rectangle:
        - t: The function is to draw a filled rectangle
        - x, y: width and height
        Circle:
        - t: color
        - radius: circle
